# Ruby101

This isn't really a book about Ruby, more like a dumping ground for random things I found amusing about Ruby.

## Generating the HTML

The format is a standard gem, so the following recipe should work

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec rake
```

Now the HTML format should be in `book/`.

## github render

github renders the markdown files to HTML so a live preview of the content can be viewed [here](https://github.com/phaul/ruby_101/blob/master/content/book.md). However this is a side effect of using github, not the intended format of this document.
